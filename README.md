## Model Elaboration

Our team has created a Library Management System as a project based on Java and MySQL. The IDE which has been used in this project is Java NetBeans. 

### Login Page

Taking a tour of the Library Management System platform, first, the user is taken to the Login page. Here, the user can Sign Up to create an account on the platform or choose to Login if they already have an account. The user is also given the facility of the 'Forgot Password' option clicking which the user can change their password in case they forgot the previous one. 

### Home Page
Once Signing Up on the platform and Logging In, the user is taken to the dashboard (Admin Panel or Home Page). In the left pane, the user has in hand a variety of features such as Manage Books, Manage Students, Issue Book, Return Book, Viewing Records or Issued Books as well as checking the Defaulter List. 

On the Admin Panel screen in the right hand side, the user is able to check metrics like Total no. of Books, No. of Students, Issued Books, Defaulter List, Student Details, Book Details as well as graphical representation of the Details of the Issued Books. The values of these metrics are displayed on a real-time basis and are taken from the database. 

### Module 1: Manage Books
The first module is the Manage Books section/feature which can be accessed from the left pane on the Admin Panel. The user has the facility to Add, Update or Delete a Book in this section. For example, in case of adding a new book to the library, the librarian enters the required details of the new book (such as Book ID, Name, Author's Name, Quantity, etc.) in the left pane, clicks on the Add button and the Book gets appended into the system records (shown on the right hand side as a table). Note that whenever someone issues a book, the book quantity gets updated accordingly. Similarly, the Update and Delete functions can be utilized. 

### Module 2: Manage Students
The second module is the Manage-Students feature. Just as the Librarian can manage books in the Manage Books section, the Student Records can also be managed in the same manner, using the Add, Update and Delete Features. The Student Details are keyed in/chosen from the drop-down menu options into the corresponding fields and Added/Updated accordingly. The results are displayed in the table on the right hand side. The records can be selected on the right side table and then Deleted. 

### Module 3: Issue Book 
In the Issue Book Module, the librarian needs to enter the Book ID and Student ID into their respective fields. The Book details and the Student details of the entered IDs appear on the two panes in the left hand side. After setting the Issue Date and the Due Date and clicking on the Issue Book button, the user gets a message on screen that the book has been issued successfully. The book quantity also gets updated simulataneously in the system records. On the Due Date when the student returns the book, the book quantity gets updated accordingly. 

### Module 4: Return Book
In the next module which is the Return Book section, the Librarian enters the Book ID of the issued book and the Student ID in their respective fields on the right pane. The corresponding details are displayed in the left pane. On clicking the Return Book button, the user gets a message that the book has been returned successfully and the Book Quantity gets updated in the System Records. 

### Module 5: View Records
In the View Records section, all the records of books can be viewed along with their issue status. The librarian can search by Issue/Due Date as well.

### Modules 6 and 7: Issued Books & Defaulters' List
Their is a specific section reserved to view the list of Issued Books, labelled as Issued Book List. Similarly, the Librarian can view the Defaulters' List as well.
